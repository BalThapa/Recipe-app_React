# About the app.

This is a recipe-app build using basic react. From which hooks, components and props are used. Various dependencies are installed and used as per the need. Methods like GET, POST are also used.

# Contents of the app.

Components like Header, Footer, Form, Modal and Nav are also made and used along with Cards in UI section and Pages like Add, Home, RecipeDetail And RecipeLists for better performance.

# Functionality.

The main function of this app is to make the user able to browse the required recipe in cards, get detailed info by clicking the card link. RecipeList and recipe detail is displayed with the recipe's origin country and its flag. Also added free form for the users to add their own recipe.

# Data Storage.

'db.Json' is used as a local JSON server to store data in a JSON format. After the server is started user can make API calls to 'http://localhost:4001/recipes' to read and write data from db.json. Note that form from the addYourOwn is connected to db.json so that all the data intered in there is saved inside db.json file in JSON format.

# Sources and Help used.

For the completion of this project i have taken a lot of help from our teacher Margit, my friends, old tasks done previously in class along with websites like stackoverflow, w3school, react basics web pages etc.
